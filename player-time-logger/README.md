# player-time-logger v1.1.5 

#### To make it easier to add the files, go to releases and download the latest zip. Then, copy the required txt files to \liteconfig\common\macros. They should appear in game. 

### Macro bindings
##### (changes in bold) (read CHANGELOG.md for complete changes)

* ##### bind $$<removeplayer.txt> to a key/button of your choice. It will remove a specific player from the array.

* bind $$<onLeave.txt> and $$<onSeen.txt> to onChat

* (You should already have realname.txt bound to onChat. If not, bind it)

* bind \$$<cleararray.txt> to onJoinGame

* bind \$$<appendOnJoin.txt> to onPlayerJoined
  
* bind $$<cleararray.txt> and $$<printarray.txt> to **separate** buttons or keys of your choice. They clear the list of tracked players and log the list to your console, respectively.

* showelapsedtime.txt and appendOnSeen.txt don't need to be bound to anything.
