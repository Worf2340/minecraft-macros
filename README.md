# player-time-logger v1.0

#### To make it easier to add the files, go to releases and download the latest zip. Then, copy the required txt files to \liteconfig\common\macros. They should appear in game. 

### Macro bindings

bind $$<onLeave.txt> and $$<onSeen.txt> to onChat

(You should already have realname.txt bound to onChat. If not, bind it)

bind $$<cleararray.txt> to onJoinGame

bind $$<appendOnJoin> to onPlayerJoined
  
bind $$<cleararray.txt> and $$<printarray.txt> to buttons or keys of your choice. They clear the list of tracked players and log the list to your console. 

showelapsedtime.txt and appendOnSeen.txt don't need to be bound to anything.
